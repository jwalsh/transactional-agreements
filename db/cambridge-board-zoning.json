The Property is currently in a deteriorated and unlivable condition, and requires major renovation, including the rebuilding of the South wall (the right-side, as viewed from Oxford Street) of the townhouse, due to extensive wood rot, deteriorated windows, and improper framing, all as documented in the report of the Petitioner’s structural engineer (see attached Engineering Inspection Report by Sean Fennell, PE, or Fennell Engineering, Inc.).  As described in the Report, the existing structure is unique and problematic in several respects, resulting in it being inadvisable to rebuild the structure as currently built.  Mr. Yoffe has developed a proposal to renovate the townhouse in such a way as to remedy the structural problems which have caused its current deteriorated condition: specifically, Mr. Yoffe seeks to extend the A-frame pitched roof line to the South wall, thereby eliminating the problematic “clerestory” with upper level windows, to square off the South wall of the building (expanding a 13 foot portion of the wall out 3 feet), and to modify the rear egress stairway.  On the interior, he seeks to remove the third floor loft/office space and build a smaller bath in its place, and reconfigure the use of space within the building without increasing the gross floor area.  Since these renovations will result in a modification to a townhouse development that was originally built under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, Section 11.1, any such modification, even though it does not increase a pre-existing non-conformity  on the lot, requires a special permit pursuant to Section 11, subsection 11.15 (c)The exterior changes proposed meet requirements of the Ordinance with respect to roof height, setbacks and usable open space on the lot.  Specifically, extending the A-frame pitched roof line to the South wall will not result in an increase in roof height.  And the squaring off of the South wall of the building (a proposed 3 foot expansion of a 13 foot portion of the South wall), and modification of the rear egress stairway, do not result in an encroachment into side yard setbacks, nor a significant diminishment of open areas on the lot.  The interior changes (reconfiguring of space within the interior) result in a modest decrease in the gross floor area, and thus decrease the pre-existing non-conformity of the Property.  But for the fact that the townhouse was originally permitted under the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance, Section 11.1 (pursuant to which any modifications require a Special Permit under Section 11.15 (c)), the petitioner would be allowed to perform such work as of right.", "The petitioner’s requested changes to this single family townhouse will not have any impact on traffic or access or egress to the Property, and will not result in an increase in congestion or other substantial change in the established neighborhood.", "Mr. Yoffe’s proposed renovation will not adversely affect the operation of or development of adjacent uses.  The Property is bounded on both sides by large structures; the south wall faces a much larger apartment building.   The proposed exterior changes, with its modest increase in the front wall surface facing the street, will not significantly affect the street scape, view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor impair the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor significantly interfere with light and air to abuttors.", "The proposed renovations will not be harmful to the health, safety and/or welfare of the occupant of the Property or other Cambridge citizens, but will, to the contrary, greatly improve a currently dilapidated, vacant building, and remedy the structurally defective condition of the Property for future occupants of the townhouse.", "The proposed use would not impair the integrity of the district, as it requests a modest change and improvement to an existing single family home in an already dense, residential, heavily-traveled neighborhood of Cambridge.", "Boston", "MA", "2014-01-29T00:00:00" ]

The new structure would contain a small storage area. The new enclosurewill also provide for significant energy savings as this will create an airlock between the exteriorand the interior living space.The house was certainly originally built as a 2 family structure. At some point it was convertedto a single family structure, but without modifying the existing stair layout to the 2nd floor, norwith any consideration for energy efficiency. Consequently, the existing front door opensdirectly into the living space, with the stairs to the 2nd floor very close to the front door. Becauseof this tight configuration, there is no possibility of creating this storage or airlock inside theexisting footprint of the house. The proposed new addition would remedy these issues. Theexisting structure is already slightly non-conforming with respect to the front yard setback. Theproposed new structure would further encroach into the required 15’ front yard setback, butwould remedy the current difficulties.The existing house, with its current covered entry porch, is also non-conforming with regard tothe minimum 7’-6” left side setback. The current distance to the property line is approximately4’-0”. The proposed modest addition does not increase the existing side yard setback nonconformity.The existing house is already non-conforming with regard to F.A.R. However, this is due to thefact that the basement of this house is slightly over 7’ in height, and therefore is counted in theG.F.A. The modest increase of 68 square feet created by the proposed addition, addsapproximately 1 percent to that F.A.R. number, which is a reasonable request for the lifestylegain this will afford the owner.A similar request for a modification to this house was made by Ms. Lloyd to this Board in 2003(case nos. 8767 and 8770) and was granted.

The major plane of the front of the building does not change, andthe sense of setback from the street will, by and large, remain unchanged.

The dormers on the south side of the house, which make one useable bedroom and oneless useable bedroom, have been awkwardly altered in a previous renovation.

Also on the south side ofthe house there exists one of two entrances to the basement unit. The Owner would like toremove the dogshed-type enclosure around that entrance, consequently removing floor area,but would like to make a side/kitchen entrance with a small porch leading to the main floor ofthe house, and would like that porch to have a roof over it, thus adding floor area back.

At 75-77 Norfolk, an easement was negotiatedthrough the property to access one of these “older” buildings at 71-73 Norfolk Street, whichgives the impression that 75 Norfolk Street’s lot is smaller than it is.

Therear section of the house is very close to the side property line, and also violates thecurrent required rearyard setback for the zoning district. The Ordinance will be metbecause the proposed roof alteration results in no change in gross floor area of thebuilding and no change in obscured sunlight or blue sky. The proposed change will also(beneficially) reduce the amount of water run-off from the rear section roof to theextremely narrow space between 75 Norfolk and its neighbor to the north, in that onlyhalf the roof will be pitching in that direction rather than the entire rear roof. The windowchange on the rear façade of the rear section of the house is a simple relocation of anexisting window, with no increase in opening size.

The Owners of this property, Elizabeth Bartle and David Boghossian, experienced a devastating fire at this house a year ago, and are in the process of re-constructing the entire house interior and some of the exterior. While executing a renovation that respects the architecture of the original house, they are attemting to correct some previous modernizations that were historically (and pragmatically) insensitive.", "No more traffic will be generated nor patterns of access altered by this proposal. The proposed window changes have no affect upon density or traffic.", "The proposal does not affect the continued operation nor the development of adjacent uses in the neighborhood.", "No nuisance or hazard causing detriment to any citizen of the City will be caused by the granting of this proposal.

The additionals FAR area relief requested is to allow \" reasonable arrangement and layout of the residential unit inside this existing structure\"  ( quoted from article 5.28.21)Specifaclly, the proposed revised plans are intended to allow:1. Improved access into the upstairs unit by plan changes to fit an enlarged new stair to code.2. Improved access to daylight and southern exposure in primary living areas.3. Access to provate outdoor open space & rear garden by the proposed rework of the back porches with upstairs deck & stair.The program for the upstairs unit, as before, is for 2 bedrooms, with the seconf BR for fammily, visitors or a potential caregiver to be relocated onto the 3rd floor.Pertinent context information for this petition is that these owners sought, and were granted variance approval by the BZA back in 2004 for this property, to build a large third floor addition (with raised roof & 32' dormer lengths both sides) but were unable to proceed with constructions at that time due to unexpected changes in family circumstances.Thecurrent proposal to add a half story on 3, has been significantly downsized rom the scope of the 2004 variance approval, i.e to raise roof, and a construct a 15' long dormer on one side for necessary stair clearance.  Additional project planning constraints stem from the need to preserve as intact as possible the layout of the existing first floor unit (already fully renovated)  for budget reasons.", "The modest increase in FAR/building bulk requested and the revised roof geometry proposed is believed to fit well within the scale of the neighborhood context of surrounding houses, and within the spirit of the recommended dormer guidelines.", "The existing stair configuration and headroom limitations to access second floor in this particular instance is more constrained and difficult to negotiate than is usual in older homes, or than is acceptaable,  and requires additional space to redress while maintaing a 2 bedroom home.", "The key component driving the layout changes proposed is to improve the stair situation.  The existing front stair currently presents a real hardship with its combination of steep and tight winders and extreme limitation of headroom clearance at the turn, such that no standard sized refrigerator or sizeable furnitureitems (or a stretcher in a medical emergency!) can fit upstairs.The existing back stair is so narrow,steep,winding and dark, as to be virtually unusable, if not dangerous to negotiate while carrying anything, such as a laundry basket.The revised plans seek to redress these deficiencies by framing out a generous new front stair, with proper headroom and without winders, and tuck an improved basement access stair below that.  Relocation of BR #2 to the 3rd floor allows room for a laundry on 2(avoiding trips to basement) and also allows some south facing windows to let direct sun/warmth into the primary living area.  The existing attic floor, while it exists, has the ridge framed too low (6'-11\" up to bottom of ridge framing) to create rooms of habitable dimension.", "Attached", "Attached", "Attached", "The south building face ( see photo of \"right side elevation\") does not immediately/directly adjoin the the side of the neighboring house as they are separeted by both the width of the neighboring driveway and by an existing screening element of tall thin deciduous trees that have grown up along the south propertyline fence. Petioner believes no detrimental intrusion into neighboring privacy will be effected by this change.    The anount of the intrusion into the side setback zone as documented in the certified plot plan attached to this petition is only a matter of six inches (existing side setback is 7'-0\" rather than the the 7'-6' required by the zoning ordinance).The petitioners intention in reworking/adding windows on the south side is to allow more direct sun into their reconfigured living area at the second floor, which would be accomplished in large part through the top sashes of proposed doublehungs, while the bottom sashes could remain screened with a window treatment as needed to insure privacy is maintained between neighbors.", "Attached", "Cambridge", "MA", "2015-02-26T14:41:43" ]

The 1977 subdivision created an odd configuration of lots, some with zero lot line setbacks.  The Owner wishes to create a more usable and pleasant space for his bedroom.  This modification would not add any additional G.F.A. to the house.  And the Owner has already obtained an as-of-right building permit for the modification of part of this same roof, and obtaining the variance for the remaining part of the roof would simplify the construction process and unify the appearance of the façade.Variance 2: Allow a cantilevered window seat on the east façade to touch the ground in the side setback: A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would not allow this request, as the new window seat, which replaces two smaller window seats from the earlier unit configuration, is inside the required side setback.  Granting this variance would allow the construction to more closely replicate the previous window seats, which did touch the ground, and will provide a more stable structural solution for the seat and wall.  The Owner has already obtained an as-of-right building permit for a cantilevered window seat, and requests that a more reasonable structural solution, by touching the ground, be allowed.Variance 3: Allow a cantilevered fireplace on the east façade to touch the ground in the side setback. For reasons similar to those stated in Variance #2 above, we request the ability to place the base of the (zero clearance, manufactured) fireplace on the ground.  These townhouses are built as a slab on grade, meaning the first floor level is just a few inches above grade.  Cantilevering the fireplace (which is currently permitted) would result in an odd space, perhaps less than 12” in height, from the grade to the underside of the fireplace framing.  It would seem reasonable to place this fireplace on its own secure, but minimal, foundation.", "Granting relief will not be a detriment to the public good.  Variance 1: The proposed modest modification of the roof will not affect the public good at all.Variance 2 and 3: Whether the window seat and the fireplace are cantilevered or touch the ground, there is no detriment to the public good.

In both a general and specific sense, the proposed modifications neither nullify nor derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.", "Variance 1: Raised Eave Height:  The 1977 subdivision created an odd and peculiar set of lot lines, and generated a number of non-conformities, and therefore the hardship.  The modification of this portion of the west eave requires a variance specifically because of the odd shaped lot.  Generally, the C-1 zone does not have such odd subdivisions, and thus granting this variance would not generally affect the zoning district.Variance 2 and 3: Cantilevered window seat and cantilevered fireplace to the ground: as mentioned earlier, the original two adjacent townhouses each had their own window seats which touched the ground.  The merging of the two townhouses into a single home required a new design, and thus the proposed window seat is in a different location than the earlier seats.  The slab-on-grade construction itself generates a hardship, as there is nearly no height difference between the exterior grade and the first floor.  Being forced to cantilever these elements will result in an odd, inaccessible space below the cantilever, inviting weeds and critters.  It would make much greater sense, from a structural and land use perspective, to allow them to touch the ground.", "The townhouse development was completed in 1977 and was immediately subdivided into fee simple single family homes.

According to Historic Commission records, the dwelling was constructed in approximately 1889 as a two-family property, was added onto in 1920, and has been occupied as a two-family home ever since.  At some point, a small dormer was added on the left side allowing room for construction of a stairwell leading from the second to third floor, where two, very small bedrooms were built under the ridge line of the steeply pitched roof.   The proposal is to renovate the third floor (2nd floor of Apt. 2) by adding a 15 ft. wide dormer and reconfiguring the existing space to allow for construction of a bathroom and full size bedroom. The dormer (by increasing the headroom in the 15 feet wide area under the dormer) will result in a 65 square feet (SF) increase in the Gross Floor Area (GFA), representing a 2% increase in total GFA in the building. This pre-existing, non-conforming dwelling exceeds the maximum allowable Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 0.50 for this Residence B District (see Section 5.31 of the City of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance (the “Ordinance”)); and thus, even this modest 65 SF increase in GFA results in an increase in FAR (from 0.715 (existing) to 0.730 (proposed)) requiring a variance pursuant to Section 8.22.3 of the Ordinance.In all other respects, the proposed renovations will meet the Ordinance requirements, specifically the Dimensional Requirements of Section 5.31 of the Ordinance.  A literal enforcement of the Ordinance would prevent the Petitioners from being able to effectively use the third floor (second floor of Apt. 2) as livable space due to the inadequate headroom. The house is in need of significant repairs, with the second/third floor apartment (Apt. 2) in greatest need of repair. The intent is to renovate so that Apt. 2 is up to modern standards and suitable for family living. There are no lesser intrusive alternatives that will provide the necessary improvements to the property.", "Both the dormer addition and a proposed open deck on the rear of the building meet requirements as to minimum setbacks and do not otherwise result in an increase in the nonconformity of the building. Further, the dormer addition will meet the City of Cambridge Design Guidelines for Roof Dormers.  The dormer addition will be located on the side of the house which faces the end of this dead end private way, and looks out onto a large, open lawn of the abutting property.  The requested relief will not result in a substantial detrimental to the public good.  The proposed dormer addition will not significantly affect the street scape, view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor will it impair the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor interfere with light and air to immediate abutters.  It will hardly be visible from Wilson Avenue, and will be seen from a significant distance away from Rindge Avenue (see attached photographs from various vantage points). Further, the dormer addition is consistent with similar dormer additions in the immediate neighborhood (see attached photographs of dormer additions within the surrounding 0.5 mile radius).", "The Petitioners seek to improve the property, while preserving the look and feel of the original 19th Century home, while rendering it more usable for modern living.  The variance sought is minimal, requesting a very modest increase in FAR, in keeping with the size and massing of the residential homes in the neighborhood, many of which also exceed the Ordinance FAR requirements.  The proposed renovations will not result in overcrowding or increased density (as they will actually reduce the bedroom count), nor create any negative impacts such as increased traffic or dangerous conditions.  And in granting the variance, the Board will support (and not derogate from) the Ordinance’s purposes, to allow for upgrading of the City’s housing stock in a manner consistent with, and supportive of the existing neighborhood.  For the reasons set out above, the Petitioner respectfully request that the Board approve the petition for a Variance.", "The existing structure is non-conforming in that it exceeds the maximum Floor Area Ratio for a Residence B District, does not meet front or side setbacks, and is sited on an under-sized (4,396 SF), and somewhat narrow (45 ft. wide) lot.

The HGSE campus consists of only six buildings centered on Appian Way.  These buildings cannot house the School's entire academic program, requiring many programs to be dispersed in leased space throughout Harvard Square.  Longfellow Hall serves as the HGSE's academic and administrative hub, containing classrooms, meeting spaces, and faculty and administrative offices. The renovation and expansion of Longfellow Hall is a key component of the HGSE's long term vision to develop a more cohesive physical campus on Appian Way. There is very limited ability to add additional space to Longfellow Hall in a manner that meets the School's programmatic needs due to existing topography and other site constraints, and the historic nature of the structure itself and its setting in historic Radcliffe Yard.  The proposed project achieves this by reprogramming existing space within the building and introducing a limited amount of new construction that is in keeping with the building's historic architecture. The project's new construction which requires zoning relief is limited to the following elements:- At the 4th floor, new construction within the required front yard setback consists of three new dormer windows at the Appian Way elevation, and a small portion of an existing light well that is being enclosed.  - At the new penthouse level, a portion of this addition is within the required front yard setback.  The penthouse is being added at the ridge point of the building's existing hipped roof, and is located at the center of the building block to minimize its overall visual impact to the historic building, the Appian Way streetscape and to Radcliffe Yard. When Longfellow Hall was constructed in 1929, the building met the CZO set back requirements of 25' to Appian Way.  The building was made non-conforming for its front yard set back in 1943, when changes to the CZO set back requirements were adopted. Because the current set back requirement is a function of building height and length, the added height of the new addition requires a front yard set back of 56'-6\", meaning that portions of the new construction will be located within the required set back.The building's existing setback to Appian Way will not change, and the construction within the required setback is all located on the upper floors of the building, and well within the existing plane of the Appian Way facade.  The placement of the new 4th floor dormers on the Appian Way side of the building is consistent with the location of the existing historic dormers on the Radcliffe Yard side of the building. The penthouse placement is dictated by the location of existing paired chimneys, the ridge line of the existing roof, relationship to vertical circulation, the structure of the existing 4th floor and the historic building's strong symmetrical massing.The structural design for the 5th floor penthouse has been developed to pick up the loads of the 4th floor roof ridge line structure on the Appian Way side of the building.  The current structural design and alignment of the penthouse floor with the existing roof ridge allows these necessary connections to the existing structure to be made in the most effective way.  Moving the placement of the penthouse in anyway would have a significant structural impact to the building involving major reconstruction. Given these existing constraints, it is not possible to create an addition which meets the set back requirement.   A literal enforcement of the provisions of CZO 5.31 would require an addition that would have signficant structural impacts to the building, and would severely disrupt the building's architectural symmetry, adversely impacting a National Register listed building.", "The proposed renovation and expansion of Longfellow Hall will result in public benefits including a significant improvement in building functionality and efficiency, improved access for persons with disabilities, and a sizeable investment in one of the City's historic resources. The proposed project is consistent with the City's institutional growth policies which encourage increased utilization of existing facilities. The project will dramatically improve the accessibility for persons with disabilities including the introduction of new accessible entrances, toilet rooms and assembly spaces. The project will use sustainable construction methods and materials with the goal of achieving LEED Gold certifcation.  Through this project, Harvard is also furthering the preservation of a National Register building, and an integral part of Radcliffe Yard.", "Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place and to be altered and expanded.  The amount of nominal new gross floor area can be easily accomodated within the lot's existing FAR, and the proposed height is well below the 85' maximum in the Residence C-2 zoning district.  The proposed project will comply fully with the current CZO requirements with the exception of proposed additions within the front yard setback.  The increase in the existing front yard set back non-conformity is the result of the increase in building height and its impact on the set back formula, however, the project will result in no physical change to the actual set back of the building to Appian Way. Therefore, the requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will further the preseravation of a legally non-conforming historic structure while significantly improving the efficiency and functionality of its intended use.", "Longfellow Hall is situated among several historic Harvard institutional buildings that surround Radcliffe Yard. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a contributing building in the Old Cambridge Historic District.  The building's location, surrounding topography, site characteristics, and historic character pose constraints on Harvard's ability to increase the building's program area while respecting the building's architectural character and adequately addressing the School's programmatic needs.Expansion of the building toward Radcliffe Yard would significantly impact the historic integrity of the Yard, and would also need to address a significant change in grade from Appian Way.  To the east, the building is bordered by the Radcliffe Insitute's \"sunken garden\" a significant historic landscape element on the Radcliffe campus that has been recently restored. One of the key character defining elements of the buildings is its overarching symmetry, both in its massing and in architectural details. (The building is closely patterned after Harvard's University Hall which was designed by Charles Bulfinch, and constructed in 1815.)  Additions or expansion at the western side of the building would have an adverse impact on the building's strong symmetrical massing, and require significant structural and mechanical intervention in the original historic building.  The additions as proposed have been reviewed favorably by the Cambridge Historical Commission as an appropriate and well considered expansion to the building. Finally, Longfellow Hall is located in an area comprised almost solely of other Harvard institutional buildings.  Longfellow Hall and its proposed addition are consistent with the size and physical character of these surrounding institutional buildings.  The location of Longfellow Hall amidst an institutional campus, the architectural character of the building itself and the historical signficance of the properties surrounding Radcliffe Yard are circumstances that do not generally affect the Residence C-2 zoning district.", null, null, null, null, null, "Cambridge", "MA", "2014-02-27T16:17:17" ]

At the time they purchased the property, there was a partial roof over the existing second floor deck, but it was in poor repair.   As part of their as-of-right renovation they removed that small roof, but left the existing structure in place.  Now, after having lived in the house for 2 years, the Owners are requesting a variance to rebuild that roof to provide adequate weather protection for the new door that was installed for what is now the master bedroom, as well as to protect the rear side of the house, with its various openings, from the weather.  The variance is necessary since the new G.F.A. exceeds the allowable by 98 square feet.  The variance is also required since the new roof will encroach on the left side setback by approximately two feet.The existing house is conforming in all respects, except with regard to the left side setback.

These modest improvements will allow the house to be renovated and converted back to being a single-family residence, as it was originally. 1)\tAn outside stair, from ground level to the third floor, was constructed around 1970 and enclosed in 1998. This stair will be eliminated, and the original internal stair from the second to the third floor will be restored. Modifying the stairwell addition by filling in the small triangles and raising the roof to match the existing roof level will allow the stair to be converted to living space. It will also eliminate the awkward existing condition of the stair tower wall where it meets the house wall at a very sharp angle, which presents maintenance difficulties, and a dangerous ice condition in the winter. Filling in two triangles on the second floor and two on the third floor will add 12 square feet. The new roof will be the same height as the existing non-conforming roof (approx 37 feet).2)\tA new mudroom and entry door at the first floor level of the former stair tower will be accessed from a porch with a new roof to replace the existing roof, with the depth of the roof increased from 3 feet to 4 feet to provide convenient and safe access. The existing non-conforming yard setback at this location will change from 8.4 feet to 7.4 feet due to the increased width of the porch roof. The new roof will be 8 square feet larger than the existing roof. 3)\tProposed improvements include two new third floor dormers. One of the new third floor dormers will allow for the installation of a new elevator, which will facilitate long-term occupancy for the owners (“aging in place”). The other new dormer will provide a second window for the bedroom, matching the existing windows in the adjacent bedroom. The eight existing dormers comprise 34 lineal feet, and the two proposed dormers will add 9 lineal feet (Ordinance limit is 15 lineal feet). As these dormers are situated in a large mansard roof, and are distributed on all four sides of the roof, the architectural design intent of the Dormer Guidelines will be met. 4)\tIt is also proposed to relocate three existing third floor dormers, which will not change the FAR. One of these dormers, on the Acacia Street side, will be located within the required front yard setback, but faces a street and therefore does not require relief.The pedestrian traffic and patterns of access and egress will be essentially unchanged. The principal façade of the house on Ash Street will not be changed. The proposed improvements will not cause a congestion hazard, or a change in the character of the neighborhood.

One entrance is on Cambridge Parkway, which runs between the building and the Charles River. This is a single-lane, one-way street with very little vehicular traffic. That which exists is slow-moving. The other main entrance, which has much greater visibility, faces Edwin Land Boulevard, a six-lane two-way high-traffic boulevard. Those looking for the 55 Cambridge Parkway building are at a disadvantage because the “55 Cambridge Parkway” entrance they might be looking for is facing “Edwin Land Boulevard”, and therefore a more visible sign on a clearly defined architectural background would be to their advantage in locating their destination.One solution to the lack of current visibility of the sign could be individual letters that are individually illuminated, providing better recognition at night. However, this produces two hardships. For the public, this would not help with daytime visibility. For the owner, the building façade exists with only one power source at that façade, an existing light fixture above the sign. Power would need to be pulled to additional locations for each individual letter, requiring significant added cost for electrical and masonry work.", "Fast moving eastbound traffic on Memorial Drive is funneled onto Edwin Land Boulevard and drivers continue at the same speed as which they were already traveling. The posted speed limit on Memorial Drive is 35 mph but drivers routinely travel at speeds of approximately 45-50 mph in this location. Edwin Land Boulevard is three lanes in each direction with no breakdown lane. Cars are not able to quickly and readily identify the entrance to 55 Cambridge Parkway or react in time to pull into the parking garage. There is no breakdown or turning lane on either side of Edwin Land Boulevard and when drivers realize, often too late, where the entrance is, the safety of others is at risk as drivers brake hard to make the turn into the parking garage. We believe the best way to achieve the necessary heightened visibility is to place the address within an architectural background to break the connection that the letters have with the red brick façade, allowing for building identification from further distances. The improved sign is designed to minimize traffic confusion and allow for safe lane change to access the property.", "At night, only the letters will be illuminated, which are within the 60 SF allowable size limit. The architectural background is opaque aluminum allowing it to visually disappear at night leaving the letters lit at 60 SF and meeting the intent of the bylaw.The entrance facing Edwin Land Boulevard has a courtyard surrounded by a two-storey brick wall with an arch that is approximately 23’-0” high, under which building visitors and occupants must pass when entering the building. The scale of this entrance is monumental, and the current signage feels out of scale on the expansive plane of red brick. By keeping the lettering the same size, within the 60 SF limit, but setting it off with an architectural background of opaque aluminum, we believe the entrance with its municipal message signage will appear better proportioned.This sign itself is a substantial investment by the building ownership and the process by which we are trying to obtain a variance is also a calculated investment. We have determined the pursuit of this signage variance to be a worthy one, and are invested in its success.", "The color of the current signage (black with gold accent) blends into the existing red brick masonry façade. One small light is mounted above the signage to illuminate it at night, but this does not provide any help with daytime visibility. We propose keeping the letters within the 60 SF allowed by the sign ordinance of Cambridge, MA, while setting the letters off of the red brick façade with an architectural background of rectangular opaque aluminum material. This gives the letters a surrounding background which will provide added visibility during the daytime hours.", "n/a", "n/a", "n/a", "n/a", "n/a", "Boston", "MA", "2014-12-19T00:00:00" ]

Kennedy Street. The following zoning relief is requested:Variance 1: Side yard setback at the proposed “West Pavilion.” (CZO 5.31, Table 5.1 Minimum side yard)•\tTo permit a setback ranging from 17’ – 23’ from the JFK Park Pedestrian Connector, conforming to prior BZA findings with respect to future development on this site. Variance 2: Height of proposed loading bays. (CZO 6.91, Location and Layout of Loading Facilities.)•\tTo permit a loading bay height of 13’ 6” in the proposed new loading facility (14’ is required). Variance 3: Width of proposed curb cut. (CZO 6.92, Location and Layout of Loading Facilities.)•\tTo permit a curb cut width at Eliot Street of 41’ (30’ is maximum). Project DescriptionAmong the goals of the proposed campus development project is to provide additional and improved teaching and study space, the creation of an environment that supports greater collaboration and active learning, and to address key physical shortcomings in the existing HKS campus including conflicts in vehicular and pedestrian circulation, compromised off-street loading facilities, and limited campus services such as a kitchen and dining facilities. To achieve these goals the HKS proposes new development on its campus that will add 76,540 square feet of new gross floor area in three additions:1)\tthe “Gateway Building,” a two-level addition connecting the existing Taubman Building and Belfer Center at the 3rd and 4th Floors.  This addition will contain faculty offices and meeting space;2)\tthe “West Pavilion,” a four-level addition connecting the existing Taubman Building with the David Rubenstein Building.  This addition will contain classrooms, meeting spaces, faculty offices, and building support spaces; 3)\tthe “South Pavilion,” a four-level addition which will connect the existing Littauer Building and the proposed “West Pavilion.”  This addition will contain classrooms, meeting spaces, faculty offices, new campus kitchen and dining facilities, and building support space. The South Building will also create a new landscaped courtyard space between Littauer and Rubenstein. The courtyard will covered by a glass roof, creating a new winter garden.  In addition to the building additions, a major component of the project is to raise the level of most of the existing courtyard by approximately 13’ to generally align with the grade level of adjacent streets at key pedestrian access points (at Eliot Street beneath the proposed Gateway Building and at the west side from the JFK Park pedestrian connector ). The raised courtyard will preserve the central campus green space while creating a new lower level that contains a below-grade loading facility, additional program space and building mechanical space. The proposed new campus development will meet all of the provisions of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance with the exception of the following three elements which require zoning relief:• The setback of the “West Pavilion,” located between the existing Rubenstein and Taubman buildings, is consistent with the alignment of existing campus buildings, and is also in conformance with prior BZA findings with respect to future development on this site. However strict compliance with the calculation of the required side yard setback along the JFK Park pedestrian connector requires zoning relief.• Due to the structural limitations of the site, a variance is required for the height of the facility’s loading bays.• A dimensional variance for the width of the proposed curb cut accessing the off-street loading facility to facilitate the safe movement of delivery vehicles.Setback at “West Pavilion”The existing HKS campus was developed in phases between 1978 and 1990.  The buildings which comprise the campus have been designed with street walls along the campus edges surrounding an open courtyard.  This pattern of development echoes the traditional organization of buildings and open space found at the Harvard Houses located nearby and other parts of the Harvard campus.  The David Rubenstein and Taubman buildings received zoning dimensional variances for their required side yard setbacks at the JFK Park pedestrian connector. The variances granted for Phase IV (Taubman Building) contained conditions that the Taubman building should be set back approximately eight (8) feet from the property line, aligning with Phase III (Rubenstein Building).  The BZA additionally found that future buildings along the connector should continue a minimum setback of eight (8) feet. The addition of the West Pavilion will result in the existing interconnected buildings along the length of the JFK Park pedestrian connector to be treated as a single building for the purposes of zoning.  Due to the length of the resulting building, a literal enforcement of the setback provisions would result in a single plane side yard setback requirement of 86’.  To achieve this setback, new construction would be required to take place near the center of the courtyard, effectively eliminating the campus’ central organizing feature and resulting in a significant reduction in existing open space. As proposed, the West Pavilion will have a setback ranging from 8’ – 23’ from the pedestrian connector, which meets the minimum setback of 8’ feet recommended for future buildings as part of the zoning variance granted by the BZA for the Taubman Building.  The requested variance will allow the central courtyard to continue to serve as the central organizing feature of the campus and to provide publically accessible open space which contributes to a network of diverse open spaces on the Harvard campus and in Harvard Square.Loading Bay HeightThe existing HKS campus is currently served by a loading facility located behind the Belfer building which is accessed from Eliot Street via the central courtyard.  Given its location, the facility does not adequately serve the campus. The current location also creates circulation conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, delivery vehicles, and other vehicles entering the campus, as they all use the same access drive from Eliot Street. The proposed campus development will create a new loading facility beneath the raised courtyard structure that will be centrally located with direct access to campus service and support spaces. The new location will have a dedicated and separated vehicle entrance from Eliot Street, eliminating pedestrian and vehicular conflicts within the central courtyard. CZO standards for the location and layout of loading facilities require that all loading bays be no less than fourteen (14) feet in height.   The bays in the proposed loading facility will have a height of 13’ 6”.  The proposed height can accommodate the largest vehicles which serve the campus (trucks with a 40’ wheelbase and a maximum vehicle height of 12’ 6”).  Bay height is limited due to the nature of the underlying foundation structure of the HKS campus (see B below).  A literal enforcement of the CZO provisions would require actions that would be detrimental to the function and feasibility of the below-grade loading dock, the courtyard, or the surrounding buildings. The 1911 MBTA rail yard slab which lies beneath the entire HKS campus and JFK Park presents a finite lower limit to practical mass excavation. Depressing the loading dock further would require completely removing a large section of the MBTA slab, inviting further structural, drainage and other complications. The option of raising the roof structure of the dock higher would result in raising the elevation of the courtyard above. This change would remove pedestrian connections between the courtyard and existing buildings and the JFK Park pedestrian walkway to the west of the site. It would also compromise the connection between the new buildings at the courtyard elevation and the existing buildings on campus.Curb Cut WidthCZO 6.92 specifies a maximum 30’ curb cut width for loading facilities. The proposed design for a wider curb cut (41') is based on an analysis of truck turning movements that demonstrated significant improvements for truck movements and overall safety with the widened curb cut.  The proposed curb cut will improve turning movements for vehicles entering and exiting the loading facility driveway thereby reducing conflicts with vehicular and bicycle traffic on Eliot Street.  A literal enforcement of the provisions of the CZO 6.92 would require a significantly narrower curb cut, which given the site geometry, would result in vehicle turning movements that would have greater impact on Eliot Street vehicular and bicycle traffic.", "The proposed new development will result in significant public benefits including: improved pedestrian access to the HKS campus by creating new at grade connections at Eliot Street and the JFK Park pedestrian connector that will facilitate cross campus circulation to other points in Harvard Square; a renewed central courtyard with improved connections to the network of existing open spaces in the Square; elimination of pedestrian and vehicular conflicts within the central courtyard; greatly improved access to the campus for persons with disabilities; and public realm improvements at campus edges and key entrances. The proposed project is consistent with the City’s institutional growth policies which encourage increased utilization of existing institutional facilities and sites.  The project will use sustainable construction methods and materials with a goal of achieving LEED Gold certification.", "The proposed development will comply fully with current CZO requirements with the exception of the requested relief.  The setback of the West Pavilion is consistent with existing development on the site, and meets the conditions for future development set forth in the BZA’s prior variance decision for the adjacent Taubman Building. The new off-street loading facility will appropriately serve the needs of the campus and eliminates existing circulation conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists, and delivery vehicles, while enabling safe delivery vehicle turning movements at Eliot Street. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance, and will permit the significant improvement of the functionality and operation of the HKS campus, and its public amenity to Harvard Square.", "Setback at “West Pavilion”The existing HKS campus was developed incrementally over a period of 12 years.  The resulting pattern of development is characterized by strong street walls at the campus edges surrounding a landscaped central courtyard echoing the traditional organization of buildings and open space elsewhere on the Harvard campus. This development pattern has been facilitated by variances previously granted by the BZA for required setbacks.  Both the pattern of existing campus development and the site’s physical constraints are unique to the HKS property and do not generally affect other properties located in the Residence C-3 zoning district.  Loading Bay HeightThe HKS campus was developed on the former site of MBTA rail yards. Due to its riverfront location, and wet soil conditions, the rail yards were originally constructed atop a massive 4’ thick concrete slab supported on wooden pilings.  All of the Harvard Kennedy School buildings are constructed atop this pre-existing monumental foundation slab. This unique structural condition creates constraints on future campus development by precluding excavation below the level of the existing slab. The existing and proposed buildings make use of foundation elements that pierce the MBTA slab at selected locations, but removal of large areas of the slab presents technical challenges at the site. Major excavation of the slab structure would require extensive and costly modification to the foundation and pile system due to the underlying soil and water table conditions.  Furthermore, records suggest that portions of the JFK Park to the south of the Harvard Kennedy School site are drained beneath the existing MBTA slab, and removal of large areas of the slab could compromise this drainage system despite localized repairs.  The presence of the pre-existing concrete slab is a site condition that is unique to the HKS campus and does not generally affect the properties located in the Residence C-3 zoning district.  Curb Cut WidthThe section of Eliot Street fronting the HKS campus is oriented to the site at an approximately 67 degree angle, creating a site geometry that is at odds with the orientation of campus buildings and site circulation. The orientation of Eliot Street to the campus requires a wider curb cut to permit delivery vehicle turning movements that reduce conflicts with vehicular and bicycle traffic on Eliot Street.  The campus’ orientation to Eliot Street is unique to the site and does not generally affect the properties located in the Residence C-3 zoning district.", null, null, null, null, null, "Cambridge", "MA", "2015-03-27T00:00:00" ]

Up until a few years ago, the building had a rear, open deck (approximately 15 ft x 10 ft) which provided both units access to outdoor open space and was the rear means of egress from the first floor of their units out to the rear yard. The rear deck when built met the then applicable rear yard set back requirements for the district. Due to shoddy construction and resulting extensive wood rot, the rear deck failed and had to be demolished. Since that time, petitioners have lacked a rear means of egress from their first floor, and have had to appeal to their insurance company to acknowledge that the rear basement entry doors were sufficient for egress purposes. The petitioners have also experienced severe flooding of their basements due to the fact that there is no longer any shelter over the rear stairs which lead from the yard below grade to the basement entryway (approximately 4-5 feet below grade). Petitioners proposal is to rebuild, creating an enclosed porch, two small decks (one for each unit owner), and a rear egress stair from the porch down to the rear yard. An enclosed porch will provide the petitioners some much needed privacy.  The property abuts a parking lot to a City of Cambridge park and pool which is frequented by people at all hours, who are oftentimes quite noisy, smoke cigarettes, drink and throw trash over the fence into the petitioners' yard. A literal enforcement of this Ordinance would result in a denial of the petitioners' application which would in turn result in a substantial hardship. Petitioners would be unable to construct an enclosed porch in order to serve their reasonable needs for privacy, usable recreational space, a rear egress from the main living floor of their homes, and a shelter over the rear basement entryway.", "The peitioners' addition will not be detrimental to the public good, as it will result in a minimal addition at the rear of the property which will hardly be seen by neighboring homeowners.  The addition will not significantly affect the street scape, view or aesthetic (the look and feel) of the area, nor will it will affect the neighbors' use and enjoyment of their own properties, nor significantly interfere with light and air to immediate abuttors. And the users of the City of Cambridge park at the rear will enjoy the view of the tastefully designed porch addition.", "The relief requested is minimal and will be in keeping with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance to protect the residential use of properties in the District. Petitioners ask that you allow for a modest increase in the gross floor area (of 242 sf.: an 182 sf enclosed porch, and a 60 sf lower level enclosed basement entryway), which results in an overall FAR of 0.50 which, if sited on a 5,000 sf lot, would be allowable as of right. The petitioners also ask that you allow for the addition and the common rear stairs to lie within the rear yard setback, where the rear yard is currently unusable due to the nuisance caused by users of the abutting City of Cambridge park at the rear. Moreover, the overall variance is minimal for the relief sought.", "The hardship is owing in part to the size and shape of the lot which is oversized (6,000 sf) thus triggering a larger than usual rear yard setback of 30 feet and a lower than usual floor area ratio maximum (of between 0.35 to 0.50).  The hardship is also owing to the location of the structure on the lot; the house is set almost squarely on the lot: 33 feet from the front lot line and 37.9 feet from the rear lot line, leaving the petitioners with a relatively oversized front yard, and undersized rear yard. Additionally, the fact that the property abuts the City of Cambridge park and the parking lot of the park, and the nuisance caused by the users of the park results in a further unique hardship.  Finally, the faulty construction design of the rear basement entryway, and resulting likelihood of basement flooding, is a further source of financial and emotional hardship for the petitioners.", null, null, null, null, null, "Boston", "MA", "2015-03-27T00:00:00" ]

Because the Divinity School campus is located in Residence A-2 and C-3 zoning districts, signage for non-residential uses is limited to two non-banner signs per building and a total area of 30 sq. ft. per building.  To adequately serve the identification and wayfinding needs of this multi-building educational campus, a variance is required to permit the area, number, and height of the proposed signs.  The campus has developed over time to include buildings on several streets with multiple access points for persons walking, driving or biking to the campus.  The access points include Francis Avenue, Museum Street, Divinity Avenue, internal pathways and a number of parking facilities.   Due to the nature of the campus, the proposed directional signs are not associated with a building, but rather are designed to guide visitors through the campus to campus buildings.  A literal enforcement of the provisions of the CZO 7.16 would permit a maximum of two signs per building and preclude the Harvard Divinity School from installing adequate signage to effectively provide wayfinding for campus visitors and users.  This limitation would prevent Harvard Divinity School from adequately identifying all entrances and providing clear directional information to key campus buildings on the Divinity School campus.  Such enforcement would create a significant hardship by impacting campus operations (for example the lack of clear identification of locations for receipt of mail and deliveries, and for emergency response).  It would also make wayfinding more difficult for the many visitors to the Divinity School campus including prospective students and their families or for people attending events held on campus.", "The requested variance is needed to properly identify the buildings on the Divinity School campus.  Therefore, the granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public good. On the contrary, the granting of the variance will in fact be a benefit to the public good, as it will guide visitors to the Divinity School campus.  Given the proximity of the campus to the Shady Hill National Register District, the proposal has been reviewed by the Executive Director of the Cambridge Historic Commission.", "The requested variance will allow the placement of campus wayfinding signs to guide visitors to the Divinity School campus, which is consistent with the CZO’s assertion that the public interest is served by use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available. Unlike most buildings in Residence A-2 and C-3 districts, this is an educational institutional facility, and therefore requires visible signage to meet the stated public interest. Thus, granting the requested variance will not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.", "The Harvard Divinity School is a multi-building educational campus with buildings fronting on several streets including Divinity Avenue, Museum Street and Francis Avenue.  The campus has multiple access points with visitors arriving on the campus from city streets, nearby parking garage facilities and internal campus pathways.  Buildings have multiple front doors, including those facing the street and those that are internal to the campus.Due to the physical characteristics of the multi-building educational campus, additional signage is needed to identify primary access points and to facilitate visitor wayfinding to key campus buildings.  The need for greater flexibility in the signage permitted for non-residential uses in the Residence A-2 and C-3 zoning districts is unique to the function of a multi-building educational campus, and is not typical of other uses in the Residence A-2 and C-3 zoning districts.", null, null, null, null, null, "Cambridge", "MA", "2015-07-01T15:37:20" ]

Project DescriptionHarvard University has a decentralized campus serving the undergraduate college and twelve graduate and professional schools.  To promote a more integrated campus for all members of the Harvard community and visitors, the University is proposing to transform three floors of the Smith Campus Center (SCC) to create a campus center that builds community with an emphasis on connectivity and transparency, and engages the building with Harvard Square.  The SCC aims to provide flexible, accessible and sustainable spaces that permit a wide range of uses including eating, gathering, meeting, studying, performing and exhibiting the arts. The heart of the SCC will include a large, open plan interior “living room,” as a companion to the exterior “living room” of Harvard Yard. It will also establish a welcoming and vibrant entrance to Harvard University for visitors, current and prospective Harvard affiliates, and the Cambridge community.  The project will maintain food services throughout the first floor of the building.  The majority of the first floor and half of the second floor, which house the Welcome Area, Common Spaces and food venues, will be open and available to the public.  The project calls for a transformational improvement of the public realm with enhanced amenities and unique spaces that do not exist elsewhere in Harvard Square.  Given its envisioned role as a campus hub, the SCC is ideally located just steps away from the MBTA station and Harvard Yard in Harvard Square. To achieve this vision for the campus center, Harvard proposes to renovate and selectively reconstruct portions of the SCC building, the former Holyoke Center.  This building was originally constructed in the early 1960’s as a mixed use educational institutional and commercial building and was designed by renowned architect Josep Lluís Sert. The project has been carefully designed to respect Sert’s original planning and design principles relating to connectivity, scale, massing, light, and façade and roofscape. The building is also located in the Harvard Square Conservation District. The project received a Certificate of Appropriateness in April 2015 after the Cambridge Historical Commission determined that a majority of the objectives of the Harvard Square Conservation District are satisfied by the design. (See Appendix for Certificate of Appropriateness.)The existing first and second floors are highly fragmented with limited connectivity between the first floor pavilions and the arcade, between the first and second floor levels, and within the second floor. In light of these limitations of the existing structure, the proposed project will selectively demolish approximately 10,000 square feet and add net new floor area of 7,500 square feet both internal to the building via parking and mechanical space conversions as well as several exterior additions.  The proposed Smith Campus Center project will meet all of the provisions of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance with the exception of the three elements which require zoning relief and are described below.\t1.\tFAR The existing Smith Campus Center building was built as-of-right beginning in the early 1960’s over two phases and is located in the Harvard Square Overlay District.  The purpose of the Overlay District is to “facilitate the protection and enhancement of the historic resources and character of Harvard Square while not unreasonably limiting the opportunities for appropriate contemporary changes to the built environment in the Harvard Square area.” (CZO 20.52)Over the years, the building has undergone a number of alterations and small additions, and has previously received zoning relief for FAR. A recent comprehensive analysis of the building indicates that the existing FAR is 4.38, which exceeds the allowable FAR of 4.0 for non-residential uses in the Business B zoning district within the Harvard Square Overlay District (CZO 20.54.6).  To make the campus center program and layout feasible given the physical constraints of the existing building and site, the proposed project requires a slight increase in FAR by 0.1.  This represents 7,512 net new square feet, resulting in an FAR of 4.48, which is a 2% increase in overall GFA from existing. The newly created GFA will be partially offset by new spaces that are exempted from the GFA calculation, such as new mechanical spaces, elevator machinery rooms, and exterior landscape. This 7,512 net new SF is located on several levels of the building:  Floor 10 \t554 SFFloor 2/Mezz\t5,971 SFFloor 1 \t\t-38 SFBasement \t1,592 SFThe specific program areas that comprise the net new floor area are described in detail below:•\tBasement:  Underground Garage Conversion for Support Space:  The basement level, which is a total of approximately 60,524 square feet of gross square footage (GSF), will require a support kitchen for the commercial food venues, support storage, and an elevator shaft space, for a total of 1,592 square feet of newly converted gross floor area (GFA).  Since a significant portion of the basement area does not currently count toward the FAR calculation because of its exempted use as an underground parking facility, the variance request is to convert a small portion of the underground garage into FAR.  This reprogramming of existing space will allow the project to (a) maximize use of the first floor for public uses, (b) create a more efficient kitchen operation that can easily service the food venues above, (c) leverage adjacencies to service ramps, trash rooms, storage, delivery areas, and (d) contain cooking smells.•\tFloors 1 and 2:  Welcome Area Pavilion:  An essential component of the SCC program is to create a transparent Welcome Area to Harvard University for visitors and the community.  The location of the Welcome Area is proposed at the front door of the building which is adjacent to the Harvard MBTA station and the Harvard Yard.  At the first and second floors, a new, highly transparent, double height Welcome Area Pavilion addition engages the exterior plaza for better comfort, utility and accessibility and is consistent with Sert’s original design principles. Sert’s pavilion design language is utilized to provide adequate space to meet fundamental visitor and community needs such as an information desk, events information, ticketing services, indoor / outdoor seating, chess program, public restrooms, indoor / outdoor commercial dining, and meeting space.  The proposed design requires the demolition of the first floor greenhouse (945 SF) and the reconstruction of the first and second floor Welcome Area Pavilion. The first floor of the pavilion has approximately 1,000 net new square feet which extends approximately 10’ from the existing greenhouse and allows an integrated, indoor open plan Welcome Area that increases seating to be used for all seasons. The seating can be used by the public and is not limited to food venue customers.  During temperate weather, the transparent first floor sliding doors of the Welcome Pavilion can be opened to integrate indoor with outdoor seating and activities.  The second floor is approximately 2,900 net new square feet which is double height, an important feature of Sert’s design. The new Welcome Area Pavilion aligns with and takes advantage of the existing structure of the underground garage. Without the newly created addition, Harvard would not be able to create a Welcome Area that would adequately serve its visitors and the community.  •\tFloors 1, 2 and Mezzanine:  Holyoke Street Pavilion:  Along Holyoke Street, a new pavilion is proposed replacing Sert’s existing pavilion.  The proposed use will be an indoor gathering space – indoor living room that will serve as a social, cultural, and intellectual destination, bringing together members of the community in a space that is publicly accessible.  Sert’s original pavilion is constructed on a site that accommodates a major grade shift between the arcade and the Holyoke Street level.  The original pavilion was designed with a series of fragmented, separate smaller spaces with minimal natural light and no interior connectivity between the spaces and between the arcade and the street.  In addition, the existing rooftop does not have structural capacity to be an interior floor.  In order to achieve the intent of the new program and meet Sert’s design principles, the proposed project demolishes the existing pavilion and reconstructs a transparent pavilion that maximizes natural light and landscape elements (10,496 SF) and includes a small infill addition on the first floor (341 SF).  The central gathering space on the first floor transitions the level difference between the arcade and the street gracefully and visually and physically connects the mezzanine and second floor spaces.  If the existing pavilion is not reconstructed it would not be possible to meet the programmatic requirements and meet Sert’s design principles.•\tFloor 2:  Dunster Street Pavilion Roof Terrace:  The proposed SCC project maximizes and improves outdoor space on the first and second floors to create usable gathering space. The Dunster Street Pavilion will transform an existing unoccupied mechanical roofscape into a usable exterior green roof that will be publicly accessible. New GFA (212 SF) is required to create circulation to access that space.  Without the new GFA the proposed exterior green roof could not be accessed by stairs which would not provide adequate egress.•\tFloor 10:  Projecting Bay:  The tenth floor program calls for a small but highly transparent projecting bay (116 SF) that will create a new beacon and focal point at the roofline of the building, converted from a portion of an existing roof terrace (that counts towards existing GFA).  Used as an event space that will be an active and animated use, the projecting bay signals a civic gesture to the broader community.•\tFloor 10:  Mechanical Conversion to Program Space:  Existing mechanical space within the building that is no longer required due to more efficient systems will be converted to usable program space for the campus center meeting and events space (438 SF).A literal enforcement of the provisions will prevent the campus center from meeting the critical programmatic and layout requirements that will serve the Harvard and Cambridge community and from establishing comprehensive circulation and accessibility paths through the building.2.\tHeight At the time of the original construction, the allowed height in the Business B district was 100 feet plus a one-story penthouse. As designed and built, the first nine floors of the Smith Campus Center building were 97’, and the tenth floor was considered a 15’ penthouse for a total building height of 112’.  In 1979, new height restrictions as established by the creation of the Harvard Square Overlay District made Smith Campus Center nonconforming for height.  As envisioned by the proposed project, the tenth floor on the Massachusetts Avenue frontage will have a new highly transparent projecting bay as part of a series of meeting and event spaces. The projecting bay, constructed within the existing eastern terrace, will signal the new use and forms a compositional relationship with Sert’s existing roof monitors and the new Welcome Area Pavilion.  The projecting glazed volume at the tenth floor is 3’-11” taller than the existing 112’-1” roofline to 116’.  This slight height increase is very limited in size, comprising only one room 23’-6” in façade length and representing approximately 600 square feet, 2% of the total roof area. The requested increase will be set in the context of a roof with many other taller elements including three stair towers at 125’-9”, a cooling tower and two mechanical rooms at 130’, and two elevator machine rooms, one at 131’ and the other at 154’.  The proposed increase will have no shadow impact and will subtly add visibility of the building form from view-points north of Harvard Square, Massachusetts Avenue at Cambridge Common, the Science Center, and Harvard Yard.  The overall transparent bay will serve as a civic gesture to Harvard Square, a contemporary expression similar in nature to the historic bell towers, cupolas, and steeples that currently punctuate the Harvard Square skyline.A literal enforcement of the provisions will require the projecting bay to remain at the 112’ height which would diminish the visual impact of the rooftop beacon in Harvard Square.3.\tNonconformityThe Smith Campus Center is considered to be nonconforming with respect to FAR, height, parking, and loading. As a result of the proposed FAR and height variance requests, it is also necessary that the project seek zoning relief to allow a legally nonconforming structure to be altered and expanded by 2% from existing.  As provided in the State General Laws (Section 6, Ch. 40A), the CZO permits the change, extension, or alteration of a pre-existing nonconforming structure or use as outlined in Article 8.000 so long as the change, extension, or alteration will not be “substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood than the existing nonconforming structure or use.” (CZO 8.22). This project has been designed to be sensitive to the building’s original design principles and consistent with the Harvard Square Conservation District objectives and will provide a significant number of public benefits.", "The requested relief enables a transformational improvement of the public realm at this site. In response to feedback garnered at a number of public forums including the City of Cambridge’s Harvard Square Placemaking workshops, community open houses, and from the Harvard Square Business Association and Harvard affiliates, the Smith Campus Center program and design have been tailored to ensure that the building engages the vibrancy of Harvard Square and meets the needs of Harvard affiliates, visitors, and the Cambridge community.  The project calls for improved and expanded seating areas, food venues, and visitor services that are welcoming to all. The areas of the building available and open to the public will significantly increase through this project. Forbes Plaza will be redesigned to include comfortable seating, chess tables, and new plantings that are inviting and allow for flexible outdoor usage for performances and public art. The new transparent Welcome Area pavilion includes seating areas on the first and second floors with views of Harvard Square and Forbes Plaza for full-year enjoyment. The redesigned Mount Auburn Plaza calls for a lush grove of trees to create a more contemplative plaza with seating, chess tables, and more legible and improved site circulation.  Dunster Street will be lined with eateries and outdoor dining, with a second floor roof garden overlooking the street for a unique Harvard Square experience that can be enjoyed by the public.  The Holyoke Street Pavilion will house food venues and event space, which will create an active street front. Services and amenities will be enhanced including information and ticketing on events and activities at Harvard University, and bike parking. The number of public restrooms will increase and will be relocated to a more convenient location. The sustainable design approach includes green roofs and green walls, plentiful natural light, rainwater collection and reuse, a high performance glass facade that maximizes energy efficiency, an interior garden within the arcade, and healthy building materials. The project creates no detriment to the public good in terms of traffic impact as it will serve the same Harvard affiliate and visitor population as it does today in a location that is highly pedestrian-oriented and transit accessible. Harvard undertook a voluntary traffic study that validates that the project will have no adverse traffic impacts and has reviewed the project with the Cambridge Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department.The small height increase (for a 600 square foot room with a highly transparent projecting bay) will be only 3’-11” taller than the existing roofline. The small increase will be set in the context of a roof with many other taller elements including three stair towers at 125’-9”, a cooling tower and two mechanical rooms at 130’, and two elevator machine rooms, one at 131’ and the other at 154’.", "Both the Massachusetts Zoning Act and the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance allow nonconforming buildings to remain in place, and even to be expanded, so long as the change, extension or alteration is not substantially more detrimental to the neighborhood.   The Smith Campus Center project will not create any significant detriment to Harvard Square. The project calls for a continuation of the building’s institutional and commercial uses. It will continue to serve the Harvard University population, visitors, and the Cambridge community as it does today during the same general time frame from early morning to late at night. The proposed project calls for no adverse impacts in terms of traffic or shadows, and the project was designed to provide significant public benefits. Therefore, requested relief does not nullify or substantially derogate from the intent or purpose of the Ordinance.  Granting the requested variance is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Ordinance and will permit the significant improvement of the functionality and operation of the Richard A. and Susan F. Smith Campus Center and its public amenity to Harvard Square.", "Topographical changes around the large site resulted in the existing building design having various ground floor levels that do not align or connect, creating barriers to accessibility, permeability, and the creation of larger consolidated spaces. The second floor rooftop does not have structural capacity to serve as an interior floor.  The current configuration of the central arcade and the retail spaces along Holyoke Street conflicts with the proposed Holyoke Street section and façade arrangement. To overcome the incompatible floor level and structural conditions, this pavilion will be reconstructed with a new second floor, resulting in an open plan layout which is fully permeable, accessible, and allows a continuous floor plate for larger gatherings and events.  The unique location of the site at the heart of Harvard Square and Harvard University creates a need to accommodate and orient the many visitors to Harvard Square and the University as well as University affiliates and the Cambridge community.  The comfort facilities and other amenities of the Welcome Area require space in the front part of the building where most visitors arrive, closest to Harvard Yard and the MBTA station. Additional GFA is required because the existing building layout creates barriers to expansion within the building. The vehicular ramps to the basement are located directly south of the proposed Welcome Area, creating a barrier to physical expansion southward. The ramps must be maintained for parking and servicing of the building. The adjacent arcade also must be maintained as a critical circulation pathway. Sert’s iconic design for the existing structure also constrains the design of the renovations. The project, and in particular the two-story Welcome Pavilion and the tenth floor bay, has been designed to create quality space while respecting Sert’s original planning and design principles relating to connectivity, scale, massing, light, and façade and roofscape.", null, null, null, null, null, "Cambridge", "MA", null ]
